Creative Exercise 1a: Drawing a Triangle

Your goal is to create a program that prints the following figure. Your code should use loops (i.e. shouldn’t just be five print statements, that’s no fun).


public class Triangle {
   /* This is the program for build a triangle. */
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       int col = 0;
       int row = 0;
       while(row <= 5){
          col = 0;
          while(col < row){
             System.out.print("*");
             col++;
          }
          if(row == col)
             System.out.println("*");
          row++;
       }
   }
}
